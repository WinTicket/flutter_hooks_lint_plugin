# flutter_hooks_lint_plugin

flutter_hooks_lint_plugin is a dart analyzer plugin for [the flutter hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks), inspired by [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks).

## Rules

### Missing/Unnecessary keys

Lint to detect missing, unnecessary keys in the `useEffect` calling.  
It finds _build variables_ (class fields, local variables, any other build-related variables) in the HookWidget, then compares references of the build variables and specified keys in the `useEffect` calling, and reports a lint error if there are any differences.

```dart
final variable1 = callSomething();
final variable2 = callSomething();

useEffect(() {
  print(variable1);
}, [variable2]); // <= missing key 'variable1', unnecessary key 'variable2'
```

### Avoid nested using of hooks

Lint to detect nested using of hooks which is one of the bad practices.  
It reports a lint error if there are any using of hooks under control flow syntax (`if`, `for`, `while`, ... ).

```dart
if (flag) {
  final variable = useState('hello'); // <= avoid nested hooks
}
```

## Installation

Add `flutter_hooks_lint_plugin` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_hooks_lint_plugin: ^0.0.1
```

Add `flutter_hooks_lint_plugin` plugin directive to your `analyzer_options.yaml`:

```yaml
analyzer:
  plugins:
    - flutter_hooks_lint_plugin
```

Then, Run `flutter pub get` and Restart your IDE/Editor.

## Options

You can customize plugin's behavior by the `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter_hooks_lint_plugin:
  exhaustive_keys:
    # hooks do not change over the state's lifecycle 
    constant_hooks:
      # default values
      - useRef
      - useIsMounted
      - useFocusNode
      - useContext

      # your custom hooks here
      - useConstantValue
```

## TODO

- [ ] support `Fix` (suggestion)
